ATM System Using Java OOPS Concepts
This project is a simulation of an ATM system built using Java's Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) principles. It showcases core OOPS concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. The system includes features such as:

User Authentication: Secure login functionality with account verification.
Balance Inquiry: Display the current account balance.
Cash Withdrawal & Deposit: Smooth transaction processing for withdrawals and deposits.
Transaction History: Keeps track of recent transactions for user reference.
This project serves as an example of applying OOPS concepts in real-world scenarios. It is structured, modular, and adheres to clean coding practices for readability and maintainability.
